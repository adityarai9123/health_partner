## Key Features Implementation

### Medical Records Management
Users can upload, view, and manage their medical records including prescriptions, doctor diagnoses, and test reports.

### BMI Calculation and Tracking
The system automatically calculates BMI from user-provided height and weight measurements and tracks changes over time.

### Menstruation Cycle Tracking
Female users can track their menstrual cycles, with the system predicting future cycles and providing insights about fertility windows.

### Doctor-Patient Communication
Secure messaging system allows patients to communicate with their healthcare providers, with access controls to ensure privacy.

### To Be Implemented(priority):
- [ ] Image Encryption (Medical Records): for now they are just getting saved to cloudinary without any encryption.
